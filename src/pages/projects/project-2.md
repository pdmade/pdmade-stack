A poorly-coded WordPress theme from Themeforest caused EpicRydeâ€™s site took 20+ seconds to load...painfully slow, affecting both existing and potential customers.

PDMade provided a redesign and rebuilt with speed in mind along with our favorite site editor to help studio owners make updates more easily.

In addition, we set up their Google Analytics and Search Console to better track site visits, search queries, and integrated with MindBody to track package purchases.
