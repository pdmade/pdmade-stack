A poorly-coded WordPress theme from Themeforest caused EpicRydeâ€™s site took 20+ seconds to load...painfully slow, affecting both existing and potential customers.

PDMade provided a redesign and rebuilt with speed in mind along with our favorite site editor to help studio owners make updates more easily.
