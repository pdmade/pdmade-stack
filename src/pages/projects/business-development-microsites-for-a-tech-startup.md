Startups are lean and fast. As the first company to emerge from the Google X Research & Development facility, HelixRE was moving faster than most.

While their full CMS website was being designed and built, HelixRE needed temporary website to support country-specific business proposals and time was of the essence. Working with the amazing design team at Design is Play, PDMADE built two static HTML websites, one for Singapore and one for the United Kingdom.
